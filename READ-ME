# CobraOSServers

> The core userland server suite for **CobraOS** — the retro-futuristic operating system powered by the **CMK (Cobra Micro-Kernel)**.

## 🐍 What is `CobraOSServers`?

`CobraOSServers` is a **single executable binary** (or collection of micro-services) that runs in **user mode** on top of the CMK microkernel. It provides essential system functionality that *does not belong in the kernel*, following the microkernel philosophy:

- **No drivers in kernel space**
- **No filesystem in kernel space**
- **No GUI in kernel space**

Instead, these run as **trusted userland servers**, communicating with apps and CMK via **fast asynchronous message passing**.

## 🔧 Included Servers (v0.1)

| Server        | Role                                  | Port Name     |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|
| `consrv`      | Console I/O (text output, keyboard)   | `ConsolePort` |
| `gfxsrv`      | Framebuffer access, window primitives| `GfxPort`     |
| `filesrv`     | ISO9660/FAT12 file system reader      | `FilePort`    |
| `workbench`   | Desktop environment & icon manager    | `WBPort`      |
| `netsrv`      | (Future) Minimal TCP/IP stack         | `NetPort`     |

> 💡 All servers start automatically at boot. Apps send messages to their ports to request services.

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

`CobraOSServers` is written in **C** and compiled with the **CobraOS cross-compiler**:

```bash
# From the CobraOS root directory
make servers

bin/CobraOSServers  # Single static binary (linked with libcobra)

### 🗂️ Repo Structure Suggestion

### ✅ Next Steps for Open-Sourcing

1. **Create a GitHub/GitLab repo**  
   Name: `CobraOS`  
   Description: *"A lean, Amiga-inspired OS with CMK microkernel. Fast, open, and retro-futuristic."*

2. **Add LICENSE**  
   MIT License is beginner-friendly and permissive.

3. **Write main `README.md`**  
   Explain the vision, how to build, how to run in QEMU.

4. **Tag your first release**  
   Even if it just prints “CobraOS v0.1” — it’s a milestone!
